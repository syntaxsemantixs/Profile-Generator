# Profile-Generator
  
  ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)


  ## Description:
  The motivation for this project was to be able to create an html file that has each user’s profile information. The profile would be generated based off the user’s input. This solves the problem of having to write out the html individually for each person. I learned how to use several module exports while running tests and overall using multiple files to run this program on the backend.  I was able to see how the backend can move user data into the frontend.
